Inspired by [@yoshuawuyts](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts)'s [knowledge repository](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/knowledge). I write knowledge which I lean in my work and open source projects . See [meta-knowledge](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge) for other lists by people who also record stuff on GitHub.
