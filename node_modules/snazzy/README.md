## install

```
npm install -g snazzy
```

## usage

Pipe "compact" text into the `snazzy` command to get back pretty results:

```bash
$ standard --verbose | snazzy
```

## note about version 7.0.0

`standard` is no longer bundled with snazzy. You must install `standard` manually
alongside `snazzy`.

Run `npm install standard --save-dev` to get a copy of `standard`, then run
`standard | snazzy` where you previously used to ran `snazzy`.

This method requires more steps but it's better since the user controls the exact
version of `standard` that is used. And for users who were piping into `snazzy` all
along, this means a quicker install since an extra copy of `standard` will not get
installed.
